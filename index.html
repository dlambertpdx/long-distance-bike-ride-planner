    <h1>Long Distance Bike Ride Planner</h1>
    <p>When planning a long ride of an hour or longer, it would be nice to know the location of bike shops near your planned
        route, should you need to make repairs, or need parts.</p>
    <p>With this app, you can enter your starting point and end point to see your route, your total distance, turn-by-turn directions.
        You'll also see icons indicating your estimated position in one hour increments, and the bike shops - if any - within
        a mile of those stops.</p>
